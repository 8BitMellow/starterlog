<h3>What is StarterLog?</h3>
StarterLog is a Real-Time Collaboration space for Starters.  We are focused on serving the people out there that are just doing what they love and delivering great work on their own terms.

<h3>The Happiness First Principle</h3>
When it comes to how we view the art of fulfillment we follow a very simple recipe that uses only 100% Organic Ingredients.  As we see it... 

<b>Happiness should come first</b>... then success.  Not the other way around.  If your life's basic equation is something like... "If I am Successful, then I will have Happiness" it is way to easy to move the goal post and redefine success.  And so you never quite get to Happiness, because it is always on the other side of Success.  

However if we switch the basic equation around and focus on the Happiness bit first... we can do what we love and deliver great work and have success.  It is our love, passion, and happiness ("the Why") of what we do which should drive us toward success.

We believe that we are the most happy when we are free to...<br><br>

<b>CREATE</b> new ideas and work on projects we are passionate about.<br>
<b>SHARE</b> our talent as contributors and our work as open source. <br>
<b>LEARN</b> from each other and get better at things that matters to us.<br>
<b>SERVE</b> the community by supporting the causes we believe in.<br>
